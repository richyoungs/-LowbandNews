# Lowband.News

**Lowband.News** is a lightweight, retro-friendly news headline fetcher and server designed to work on modern systems while remaining accessible from vintage computers like the Commodore VIC-20, C64, and C128 using a WiFi modem or terminal software.

This project fetches the latest RSS headlines from a configured news source and serves them as a simple text file over HTTP â€” ideal for low-bandwidth viewing and BBS-like interfaces.

You can view the software's functionality by using TELNET on the address: 144.48.104.213:2323, which will retrieve the latest headlines that the script has retrieved.
